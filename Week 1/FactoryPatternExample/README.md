# 🏭 Factory Pattern Example in C#

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Factory Design Pattern** in C#. The Factory Pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

In this example, we have a **ProductFactory** that creates different types of products, such as **Electronics**, **Furniture**, and **Clothing**.

## 📌 What is the Factory Pattern?

The Factory Pattern:
- Provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Abstracts the instantiation logic, which is useful for creating objects in a flexible and reusable way.
