# ðŸ§© Singleton Pattern Example in C#

This project demonstrates how to implement the **Singleton Design Pattern** in C#. The pattern ensures that a class has **only one instance** throughout the application's lifecycle.

In this example, the Singleton is used to manage a global `Logger` instance.

## ðŸ“Œ What is the Singleton Pattern?

The Singleton Pattern:
- Restricts a class to a **single instance**
- Provides a **global point of access** to that instance
- Is commonly used for:
  - Logging
  - Configuration management
  - Database connections
